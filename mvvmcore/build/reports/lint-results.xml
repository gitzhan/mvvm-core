        severity="Warning"
        message="Lint found an issue registry (`androidx.annotation.experimental.lint.ExperimentalIssueRegistry`) which did not specify the Lint API version it was compiled with.&#xA;&#xA;**This means that the lint checks are likely not compatible.**&#xA;&#xA;If you are the author of this lint check, make your lint `IssueRegistry` class contain&#xA;  override val api: Int = com.android.tools.lint.detector.api.CURRENT_API&#xA;or from Java,&#xA;  @Override public int getApi() { return com.android.tools.lint.detector.api.ApiKt.CURRENT_API; }&#xA;&#xA;If you are just using lint checks from a third party library you have no control over, you can disable these lint checks (if they misbehave) like this:&#xA;&#xA;    android {&#xA;        lintOptions {&#xA;            disable &quot;UnsafeExperimentalUsageError&quot;,&#xA;                    &quot;UnsafeExperimentalUsageWarning&quot;&#xA;        }&#xA;    }&#xA;"

        summary="Obsolete custom lint check"
        explanation="Lint can be extended with &quot;custom checks&quot;: additional checks implemented by developers and libraries to for example enforce specific API usages required by a library or a company coding style guideline.&#xA;&#xA;The Lint APIs are not yet stable, so these checks may either cause a performance degradation, or stop working, or provide wrong results.&#xA;&#xA;This warning flags custom lint checks that are found to be using obsolete APIs and will need to be updated to run in the current lint environment.&#xA;&#xA;It may also flag issues found to be using a **newer** version of the API, meaning that you need to use a newer version of lint (or Android Studio or Gradle plugin etc) to work with these checks."

        summary="Gradle Dynamic Version"
        explanation="Using `+` in dependencies lets you automatically pick up the latest available version rather than a specific, named version. However, this is not recommended; your builds are not repeatable; you may have tested with a slightly different version than what the build server used. (Using a dynamic version as the major version number is more problematic than using it in the minor version position.)"
